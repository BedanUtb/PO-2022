This al lis coming as a proffesional looking piece of paper per worker and the target is to motivate the employees using this. But â€“ is costs company a bunch of money and time collecting the data for external supplier not mentioning the fact that sending these data including sensitive information is very risky these days.. So you decide to programme it and save your company money and time!
